# Official repository for NConf - Enterprise Nagios configurator Dockerfiles. 
# This repo contains Dockerfiles to create NConf images for demonstration purposes. 
# These images contain all SW needed to run NConf and other useful tools to evaluate NConf functionality. 
# Since these images run multiple processes inside the same container, they are not ideal for production use. 
# Also, no data is persisted outside the container. Therefore, all data is lost when the container is stopped!
